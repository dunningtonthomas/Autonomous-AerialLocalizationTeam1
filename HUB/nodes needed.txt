mission planner hub will need to pull:
- drone position in uas class [x,y,z] every iteration
- whether rgv A and rgv B are detected in the camera view in enviornment class
- rgv A and rgv B position estimates in the enviornment class when detected

mission planner hub will need to publish:
- commanded waypoint [x,y,z]
- maybe current phase string ("Takeoff") for ground station
