/*
TO-DO and STRUCTURE

CAMERA (CLASS)
    -Object that can adjust focus, record, turn off and on, and take pictures, etc...

WIFI (CLASS)
    -A check for wifi connection and return speed?
    -Does a send/recieve function need to be written or can we assume that ROS will handle this?

MANUAL CONTROLLER
    -The controller plugs directly into the cube. We need a way to switch priority from the nano to the manual controller. 
    If this doesn't work, we can try to send manual controlls to the nano directly.

CUBE (CLASS)
    - Establish connection to the cube, send waypoints, and recieve data from the cube.
